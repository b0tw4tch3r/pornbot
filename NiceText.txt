Absolutely
After all
After you!
All the same
And so on and so forth
As a rule
As far
As I said before
As well as
Believe it or not, but
By the way
Deal!
Definitely
Did I get you right?
Don’t mention it!
Don’t take it to heart.
Don’t worry about it!
Either way
Exactly so
First of all/ above all
Good for you!
How was it?
I’m afraid so
I’m in  I’m game
I’m not sure
I’m so sorry!
I’m sorry, I can’t.
I’m sorry, I didn’t catch you.
I agree with you
I am afraid you are wrong
I beg your pardon!
I believe so
I didn’t catch the last word.
I don’t think so
I doubt it
I think I’ll pass
I'm looking forward to it
If I’m not mistaken
If I remember rightly
In a way  to a certain extent
In a word
In other words
In short
It’s a great idea!
It’s very kind of you!
It can hardly be so
It doesn’t matter.
It is new to me.
Just for the record
Let us hope for the best.
Lucky you!
May I ask you a question?
May I help you?
Most likely
Most unlikely
Naturally
Next time lucky!
No doubt
No problem that’s ok!
No way
Not a bit
Not a very good idea
Not to mention
Of course  Sure
Oh, that. That explains it.
On one hand
On the contrary
On the other hand
Perhaps
Probably
Quite so
Say it again, please.
So as to
So that’s where the trouble lies!
Sorry, I meant well.
Sorry, I wasn’t listening.
Such as
Thank you anyway!
Thank you in advance!
The thing is
Things happen.
This way, please!
Very well
What’s going on?
What’s happened?
What’s more
What’s the matter?
What’s the trouble?
What do you mean?
Where were we?
You are right
You were saying?
